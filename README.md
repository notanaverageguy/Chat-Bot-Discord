# Chat-Bot-Discord

Code in branch master

Simple discord chat bot, includes other commands

What I'm working on:
allowing the bot to do tts in a voice channel well

You can activate tts mode by doing saying tts toggle in a channel

you can also make it say anything with a voice by saying "say <message>" in a text channel, it will attempt to say what was written in a voice channel

Bot is in beta and not my main focus, expect many bugs
